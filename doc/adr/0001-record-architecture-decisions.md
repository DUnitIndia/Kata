# 1. Record architecture decisions

Date: 2020-11-01

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project so that we are able to refer back on a decision and understand the contexts in which it was made and what were the trade-offs that were acceptable and what were the forces at play when a particulardecision was taken. Teams evolve and this will provide a knowledge repository of significant architectural decisions to the new team members to get them into the context. 

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records, as [described by Michael Nygard](http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).

## Consequences

See Michael Nygard's article, linked above. For a lightweight ADR toolset, see Nat Pryce's [adr-tools](https://github.com/npryce/adr-tools).

ADR's documented will provide a good context with the future developers and help them understand the key decisions so that they can avoid re-inventing the wheel or if the forces inplay has changed, can look at alternate solutions
