# 6. Create a Listing system

Date: 2020-11-02

## Status

Accepted

## Context

As and when the business grows, the number of items selling will increase and not all items will be retailed in all fridges/kiosks/nodes

## Decision

Each node/kiosk/fridge will have a specific set of items sold depending on demography , adjacency (say in gym) or any other such factors based on assortment analysis and assortment planning

## Consequences

Having a seperate system that takes care of this association what items are retailed in what node/fridge/store. this also helps in enabling later a different price/promo etc., on each item level later. this also avoids the blanket - all items everywhere issue.
